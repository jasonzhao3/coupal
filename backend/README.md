## Core server side of Python Flask Skeleton for Google App Engine

A skeleton for building Python applications on Google App Engine with the
[Flask micro framework](http://flask.pocoo.org).

## Run Locally
1. Install the [App Engine Python SDK](https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads).
See the README file for directions. You'll need python 2.7 and [pip 1.4 or later](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html) installed too.

2. Clone this repo with

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:jasonzhao3/coupal.git
   ```
3. Install dependencies in the project's lib directory.
   Note: App Engine can only import libraries from inside your project directory.

   ```
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt -t lib
   ```
4. Run this project locally from the command line:

   ```
   dev_appserver.py .
   ```

Visit the application [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

See [the development server documentation](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/devserver)
for options when running dev_appserver.

## Deploy
Use GoogleAppEngineLauncher. A great time saver!

### Relational Databases and Datastore - Will revisit this later for user's coupon store
To add persistence to your models, use
[NDB](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/ndb/) for
scale.  Consider
[CloudSQL](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/cloud-sql)
if you need a relational database.

### Installing Libraries
See the [Third party
libraries](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/libraries27)
page for libraries that are already included in the SDK.  To include SDK
libraries, add them in your app.yaml file. Other than libraries included in
the SDK, only pure python libraries may be added to an App Engine project.
